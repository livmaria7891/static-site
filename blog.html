     <p>
      For Wave 2, I accomplished the learning goals. I showed that I could use an array to store a list of objects. I figured out how to combine an array of objects and individual objects into a single, one dimensional array. I also successfully wrote three methods in the class. Overall, I was pleased with the quality of the code but I learned that I could have written the code block inside the initialize method in a single line of code. It also looks like I also left an unnecessary line of code in the add_planets method. Besides those two things, I’m not sure at this point in time how I could have improved on what I wrote, but I would like to know more about deciding how many and which kind of methods belong in a single class.

     <p>
      For Wave 1, overall I feel like I accomplished the learning goals. I understand how to and can successfully create a class and use an initialize method. I can also create and use instance variables, however I’m not completely clear on when I do and don’t need to use an instance variable versus a ‘regular’ variable. I tend to make every variable in a class an instance variable, even though I don’t think it’s always necessary. I also see in my code that I used an attr_reader method, but only for the name variable. As look at it now, I’m not sure why I did that or what purpose it serves. If I did this project again, I would see if the code could run without it. I would also try to find a more efficient way to add information about the planets. Creating a large hash for each planet seemed a little code heavy and I wonder if there’s a way I could do it differently. I would have also used faker to save time instead of looking up real facts about the planets.
